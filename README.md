# Dio Bank

A project that aims to practice Java skills. It is part of the Java course at Dio Bootcamp as a code challenge.

The challenge objective is to build a bank concept using classes and OOP:
- Build a client class.
- Build an account class.
- Build different account classes that extends from the base account class.
- Create some basic transactions.

I improve the challenge objectives by doing:
- Convert the classes to SQL tables using JPA + Hibernate.
- Create a table/entity/class to save transactions.
- Transform transactions into SQL operations.
- Create some historic methods.
